# lem_in

The goal of this project is to find the quickest way to get n ants across a graph.

To traverse the graph and find the shortest path, I used the breadth-first search method.

## Installing

Clone the repository and:
```
make
```
## Running the tests

### TN_test_Lem_in

I have created my own test program : [TN_test_Lem_in](https://github.com/vtennero/TN_test_Lem_in)

It tests 150+ relevant examples of invalid text inputs, as well as memory leaks using valgrind.

To install it, simply put the content of the TN_test_Lem_in folder in your get_next_line folder, then do :

```
sh TN_test_Lem_in.sh
```

### Other method

```
./lem-in < map
```
